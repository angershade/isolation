SURPRISINGLY, IT EMERGED AS THE COLLECTION'S MOST ESTEEMED COMPOSITION. THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF COMPOSING, MIXING, MASTERING, AND PRODUCING &quot;ISOLATION&quot; DEMANDED A MERE 35 HOURS-A STARK CONTRAST TO THE MONTHS OF DEDICATION AFFORDED TO ITS COUNTERPARTS. THIS TRACK STANDS OUT AS ONE OF THE RARE INSTANCES WHERE I REFRAINED FROM EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS, RESULTING IN THE ABSENCE OF &quot;ISOLATION SESSIONS.&quot; THE &quot;LIVE DEMO,&quot; PERFORMED IN JANUARY 2019, MARKS THE GENESIS OF THE TRACK, CAPTURING THE SONG'S CREATION IN AN IMMEDIATE AND RAW FORM. IT WASN'T UNTIL MAY OF 2021 THAT WORK ON REINTERPRETATIONS COMMENCED, PROMPTED BY THE PRECEDING YEAR'S CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES. THE CREATION OF THIS PIECE WAS NOT A LABOR OF LOVE; THE HARSH, DISCORDANT STRINGS AND THE ABRASIVE SOUNDS OF SCRATCHING VIOLAS AND VIOLINS ENCAPSULATE MY FRUSTRATION AND RESENTMENT TOWARDS THE NECESSITY OF ITS COMPLETION RATHER THAN A GENUINE EXPRESSION OF MUSICAL INNOVATION. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THESE COMPOSITIONS WILL RESONATE WITH YOU AND BE RECEIVED WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF APPRECIATION THAN WAS EXPERIENCED IN THEIR PRODUCTION.</h4>

IT ENCAPSULATES THE ARTIST'S ORIGINAL INTENT, AS CONCEIVED DURING THE MIXING AND MASTERING PHASES IN THE STUDIO IN 2019, A VISION UNFORTUNATELY COMPROMISED BY THE SUBSEQUENT VICISSITUDES OF DISTRIBUTION AND COMPRESSION. IN THIS ENHANCED VERSION, THE BASS ENVELOPS THE LISTENER, EMERGING FROM THE CONSTRAINTS THAT PREVIOUSLY DIMINISHED ITS PRESENCE TO A MERE AUDITORY FOOTNOTE. IT NOW ASSERTS ITSELF AS A PALPABLE FORCE. THE OVERDRIVEN ELEMENTS ARE GRANTED THE LIBERTY TO EXPAND, ENSURING THAT THE SONIC LANDSCAPE IS SUFFUSED WITH A BREADTH PREVIOUSLY CONSTRAINED, AND A CLARITY IN THE MIDRANGE THAT DELINEATES AN AUDITORY DEPTH AND SPATIALITY SURPASSING ITS PREDECESSOR. FEEDBACK HAS INDICATED THAT THE ORIGINAL PIECE SERVED AS A MEDITATIVE CONDUIT FOR MANY;</h6>
